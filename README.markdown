# jquery.wizard #

Converts given elements to pages that may be navigated with auto-generated back/forward buttons. Publishes navigation information for listeners to use. The feature set of this plugin is close to existing [jquery.formwizard](https://github.com/thecodemine/formwizard) plugin, but that project is not very active and it has gotten a bit too complex for my own taste.

### Key principles of these plugins: ###
- Gradual enhancement: the original source should be usable without this plugin
- Simplicity: too many options will kill you

## .wizard(options) ##


## .wizardBreadcrumb(options) ##

Listens to published events from wizard plugin, and creats a breadcrumb.
